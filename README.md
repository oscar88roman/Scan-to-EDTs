🏗️ Scan-to-BIM to Energy Digital Twin Framework
This repository provides an end-to-end framework for converting building scan data into rich energy simulation models and digital twins. It leverages geometric assessment, semantic enrichment, and data-driven modeling to enable energy-efficient building management and forecasting.

🚀 Workflow Overview
🔍 1. Input & Preprocessing
Input Point Cloud or Scan-to-BIM (Solid Model)

Geometric Assessment generates a Topologic B-REP Model

🧠 2. Semantic Enrichment
Apply Information Loading Dictionaries (ILDs):

Thickness

Materials

Dimensions

Setpoints (Tmin, Tmax)

Devices & Rules (e.g., European Regulations)

Outputs a Building Energy Model (BEM) for simulation

🧱 3. Model Transformation
Convert to:

IFC Model

gbXML

Topologic Models (Volumetric & Thematic Surface Models)

Export using EPJSON via parser/transformer/writer tools

⚙️ 4. Simulation & Analysis
Run with EnergyPlus

Use Real-Time IoT Data & ML/DL algorithms for:

📈 Digital Twin Level 1: Real-Time Monitoring

🧪 Digital Twin Level 2: Simulation Scenarios

🔮 Digital Twin Level 3: Forecasting and Scenario Testing
